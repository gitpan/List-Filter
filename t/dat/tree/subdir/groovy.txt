Sometime in 1993 NANCY SINATRA will lead a BLOODLESS COUP on GUAM!!

..  bleakness....  desolation....  plastic forks...

I don't believe there really IS a GAS SHORTAGE..  I think it's all
 just a BIG HOAX on the part of the plastic sign salesmen--
 ..  to sell more numbers!!

Now I'm being INVOLUNTARILY shuffled closer to the CLAM DIP
 with the BROKEN PLASTIC FORKS in it!!

This ASIAGO-N-DRIED TOMATO combo would taste a lot better between two
 plastic SIPPER LIDS!
